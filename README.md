# PSDHeatmapChart
Hey there,

Regarding the Haguide project, I need to use the PSD and RMS graphs from the monopolar code from the last email about that topic  monopolar.zip . I need to extract the code in such a way that I can use the graphs as a "black box" to input data and see the graph update.

I've attempted to separate the components without success, so I would like to request a meeting or some assistance related to the task I need to complete.

Thank you in advance.

I have opened GitHub repositories to collaborate

2.	https://github.com/dolev146/PSDHeatmapChart 

Best regards,
Dolev
